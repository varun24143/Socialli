# Socialli



Socialli is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for building interoperable web3 metaverses.

These metaverses are equipped with their own social tokens, NFTs, and built-in DeFi/GeFi. Socialli metaverses are deployed on the Polkadot blockchain.

We provide SDKs and APIs to developers with complete freedom to develop innovative metaverse products and services. In addition, the innovation, by design, is usable in other metaverses, allowing mass adoption through interoperability.

\
Socialli metaverse will be collected via our genesis NFT collection. The seamless integration and economy allow land parcels to be minted, sold, or rented to earn a yield. Each metaverse consists of token gated access exclusively for its community and users.

All metaverses built on Socialli will be able to exchange tokens and assets. But more importantly, they could do the same with metaverses across multiple chains leveraging Polkadot’s cross-chain, messaging protocol, and interchain bridges.\


&#x20;Socialli aims to make history by bridging the DAOs and communities together. All this will be possible by the mass adoption of web 3.0 to all the mainstream use cases keeping metaverses at the heart of it. For this big undertaking, the Socialli team has scheduled different launch phases to focus on delivering a full featured network. The phases covering launch, governance, finalization, testnet etc., might differ in the timeline for each and every upgrade based on the council’s decision, community support and campaigning.
